## Objectives
Description of what your project is about, your key functionalities, tech stacks used, etc. 

Our project Goodreads2 is a tool designed to facilitate book recommendations and encourage social communities. The main feature of our function will be a search engine designed to intake natural language from our user and output book/community recommendations based on whatever they are looking for. For example, if the user is looking for books with a similar plotline of a mystical adventure like in the Alchemist, they will be recommended a list of books that include that. 

We want our app to include social features that allow users to join different book club-like communities based on their interests; These groups can also be filtered by our model depending on a variety of factors like activity, size, and general conversation vibe. Outside of these recommendations, our app will serve as a library of books that are read, being read, and to-be-read by our user and their groups/clubs. Our focus will be on facilitating conversations and accurate recommendations off of just a quote, vibe, or title.

We plan to use local storage for our database, AWS lambda for the backend, and React Native + Expo for the frontend work.



## How to Run
The repository will be supplemented possible by a google drive link to our stored database that will need to be downloaded and stored to our repository folder in order to run with our project.
